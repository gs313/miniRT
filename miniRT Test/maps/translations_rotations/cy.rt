#1. cylinder in y axis and camera in front of cylinder: 
#A 								0.2			255,255,255
#L		-10,10,-5				1			255,255,255
#cy		0,0,0		0,1,0		2,6			255,0,0
#C		0,0,-15		0,0,1		50


#2. same set up as number 1 but cylinder is further rotated 90deg in z axis which means its facing x axis
#A 								0.2			255,255,255

#cy		0,0,0		1,0,0		2,6			255,0,0
#C		0,0,-15		0,0,1		50

#3. Here just for fun we will display cylinders facing all sorts of funky directions
#red cylinders will face x y and z axis straight on
#blue cylinders will be between 2 axis, so diagonal between x and y, diagonal between x and z and diagonal between z and y
#the green cylinder will be between 3 axis
#you may use a vector visualizer to see which directions the non 1 vectors are facing
#feel free to add any direction but the value must be normalised and the number should be as exact as possible
#in the case of 0.70710678118,0.70710678118,0 for example, 0.707, 0.707, 0 will not work as its not precise enough sorry
